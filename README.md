This is an Android sample app + tests that will be used to work on various project to increase the quality of the Android platform.

The idea is that Android programming is still in its infancy compared to the Java world. 
The Android community needs more robustness in Android apps and it looks like a good idea to build on the Java world experience and use its best tools for Quality Analysis.

We want to provide a full featured industrial development environment that can be used to create more
robust projects on Android, by using any of the most interesting and popular technologies.

Here are [some slides](https://speakerdeck.com/stephanenicolas/devoxx-2013-fr-beef-you-android-apps-using-java-tools) to present Quality Tools for Android.

# Already integrated :

# What is missing (TODO/INTEGRATE) : 

1. get aggregated tests and code coverage for all testing technologies inside a nice Sonar dashboard for Android.
2. add support for monkey runner through maven
3. add calabash support.
4. Add support for JUnit 4 on Android : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9809180/why-is-junit-4-on-android-not-working

# Usage

This section describes how to build & test the project using those different testing technologies.

Please note that this project is under active development.
Some goals may require a snapshot version of the maven android plugin available 
on [sonatype snapshot repo](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/jayway-snapshots/).

## Install Android Latest SDK through Android SDK Manager

This can be done graphically, or [via command line (for CI servers)](http://stackoverflow.com/q/4681697/693752).

## Install the Android SDK through maven-android-sdk-deployer

As it takes time to get android jars in maven central, including android UI automator jars in maven central,
we recommend to use [maven-android-sdk-deployer](https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer) to obtain android artefacts.
This step can also be executed on a CI server.

```bash
#install Android SDK 17 local files to local maven repo  
git clone git@github.com:mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer.git
cd maven-android-sdk-deployer/
mvn install -P 4.2
#Add V4 support library (to use FEST Android)
cd extras/compatibility-v4/
mvn install
```

## Standard Android testing APIs and code coverage using emma

To build the sample project and run the sample app on a plugged rooted device / running emulator : 

```bash
# in parent folder
mvn clean install -P emma
mvn sonar:sonar -P emma
```

you will get tests results in : target/surefire-reports/.
you will get tests coverage in : target/emma/.

Here is the result in sonar : 
<img src="https://raw.github.com/stephanenicolas/Quality-Tools-for-Android/master/gfx/screenshot-sonar-emma-config.png" width=450px/>

You may need to restart adb as root to be able to pull the emma coverage file. In a terminal, type :
```bash
adb root
```

## Robolectric and code coverage using cobertura

```bash
# in parent folder
mvn clean cobertura:cobertura -P cobertura
mvn sonar:sonar -P cobertura
```
Here is the result in sonar : 
<img src="https://raw.github.com/stephanenicolas/Quality-Tools-for-Android/master/gfx/screenshot-sonar-robolectric-config.png" width=450px/>


## Unified code coverage for both Robolectric and standard Android Junit tests via Jacoco

Using offline instrumentation of Jacoco, it is possilbe to completly replace emma by jacoco for instrumentation.
This allows to get both robolectric and standard tests code coverage inside the same project dashboard with sonar.

* Robolectric are considered standard unit tests.
* standard Android Junit tests are considered as standard integration tests.
This makes sense as Robolectric tests mock an android platform and can be considered more "unit" tests thant standard android tests because the latter needs a real android platform and relies on networking, disk, locale, etc. 
It would be better to be able to give names to the test suites inside the widget, and even to add more test suites, for instance to add UI testing (black box testing) or monkey testing. 

```bash
# in parent folder
mvn clean install -P jacoco
mvn sonar:sonar -P jacoco
```
Here is the result in sonar : 
<img src="https://raw.github.com/stephanenicolas/Quality-Tools-for-Android/master/gfx/screenshot-sonar-jacoco.png" width=450px/>


## UI Automator 


```bash
# in parent folder
mvn clean install -P uiautomator
mvn sonar:sonar -P uiautomator
```
Here is the result in sonar : 
<img src="https://raw.github.com/stephanenicolas/Quality-Tools-for-Android/master/gfx/screenshot-uiautomator.png" width=450px/>

## Espresso

To build the sample project and run the sample app on a plugged device / running emulator : 

```bash
# in parent folder
mvn clean install -P espresso
```

## Spoon from Squareup

```bash
# in parent folder
mvn clean install -P spoon

#then browse to android-sample-tests/target/spoon-output/index.html
```

Here is the result in a browser : 
<img src="https://raw.github.com/stephanenicolas/Quality-Tools-for-Android/master/gfx/screenshot-spoon.png" width=450px/>

## Espresso run with Spoon

To build the sample project and run the sample app using Spoon : 

```bash
# in parent folder
mvn clean install -P espresso-spoon
```

## Monkey testing

Monkey is part of Android SDK and allows to harness Application UI and test their robustness.
We contributed to a new maven android plugin goal to use monkey automatically and get reports in junit format.

The results can be displayed inside sonar and will appear as normal unit tests.

```bash
# in parent folder
mvn clean compile -P monkey
mvn sonar:sonar -P monkey
```
Here is the result in sonar : 
<img src="https://raw.github.com/stephanenicolas/Quality-Tools-for-Android/master/gfx/screenshot-sonar-monkey.png" width=450px/>


## Package cycles check via classycle

You will need a JDK 1.7 for this profile to work correctly.

```bash
# in parent folder
mvn clean compile -P cycle
```

Will check package cycles (also called package tangling in Sonar) and check the build if given cycles are detected.
[Classycle](http://classycle.sourceforge.net/) lets you define architectural constraints that can be checked automatically. 

Depedency definition files are very simple to edit. Here is an example : 
````
show allResults

###define packages / groups of packages of interest

## layers
[ui] = com.octo.android.sample.ui.*
[other] = com.octo.android.sample.* excluding [ui]

###check layers integrity
check [other] independentOf [ui]
````
## Robolectric development in eclipse

RoboElectric tests are separated from the sample project, as all testing technologies. 

To make this configuration work in eclipse, do the following : 

//TODO update this
* after each "maven update" of your project, remember to configure the build path of your project, go to the last tab and *uncheck* maven dependencies so that they are not included into the final apk.
* in your eclipse junit configuration for your project, add both "bin/classes" to the classpath, and set the environment variable ANDROID_HOME to the android home folder on your computer.
* add the android jars from your maven repository to your junit run configuration in eclipse.

TODO : POST a SNAPSHOT of the JUnit run config in eclipse

Now, simply execute your project as a JUnit project and all robolectric tests will get executed.

## Using Gradle

All gradle-related file are stored in folder `gradle`.

With Gradle 1.8+ and android gradle plugin 0.6.+ : 

### build the app under tests

```bash
# in parent folder
gradle clean assemble
```

### launch the app under tests

```bash
# in parent folder
gradle :android-sample:installDebug
```

### play standard android tests (without emma coverage): 

```bash
# in parent folder
gradle clean assembleDebug connectedInstrumentTest
#export to sonar
gradle :android-sample:sonarRunner
```

### play espresso tests (without emma coverage): 

```bash
# in parent folder
gradle clean assembleDebug :android-sample-espresso-tests:connectedInstrumentTest
```

### play robolectric tests : 

```bash
# in parent folder
gradle clean assembleDebug robolectric
#export to sonar
gradle :android-sample-robolectric-tests:sonarRunner
```

### Findbugs + Checkstyle + PMD + classycle : 

```bash
# in parent folder
gradle check
```

or independently : 
```bash
# in parent folder
#you need to run assemble before most of those
#gradle assembleDebug
gradle checkstyle
gradle findbugs
gradle pmd
gradle classycle
```

### Running lint :
```bash
# in parent folder
gradle :android-sample:lint
```

### Aggregate reports :
```bash
# in parent folder
gradle buildDashboard
```

### TODO run test coverage using emma (standard tests): 

### TODO run test coverage using cobertura (robolectric tests):

### TODO run test coverage using jacoco (both tests): 

### TODO play uiautomator tests

### TODO play monkey tests

### TODO play monkey runner tests

### TODO shoot more stuff to sonar
